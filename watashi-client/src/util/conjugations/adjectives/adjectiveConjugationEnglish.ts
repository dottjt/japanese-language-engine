// A positive adjective is a normal adjective that’s used to describe, not compare. For example: “This is good soup” and “I am funny.”
// A comparative adjective is an adjective that’s used to compare two things (and is often followed by the word than). For example: “This soup is better than that salad” or “I am funnier than her.”
// A superlative adjective is an adjective that’s used to compare three or more things, or to state that something is the most. For example: “This is the best soup in the whole world” or “I am the funniest out of all the other bloggers.”

// if an adjective has one or two sylables, then you can add -er and -est (there are exceptions)
// otherwise if three, then it is 'more' and 'the most' prepended to the word.

// irregular comparative and superlative.
// Adjective Comparative Superlative
// good  better  best
// bad worse worst
// little  less  least
// much  more  most
// far further / farther furthest / farthest

// // how much, // how many, one, thirty, can be a number // many, half a lot
// QUANTITATIVE_ADJECTIVE

// // which noun or pronoun you're referring to.
// //
// this - singular noun close to you.
// that - singular noun far
// these - plural noun close
// those - plural noun far

// // when responding to a question, you can sometimes leave out the noun being described.
// 

// My - Belong to me
// His - Belong to him
// Her - Belong to her
// Their - Belong to them
// Your - Belong to you
// OUr - Belong to us
// 

// All these adjectives, except the word his, can only be used before a noun. You can’t just say “That’s my,” you have to say “That’s my pen.” When you want to leave off the noun or pronoun being modified, use these possessive adjectives instead:

// Mine
// His
// Hers
// Theirs
// Yours
// Ours

// INTERROGATIVE // ask a question

// Which — Asks to make a choice between options.
// What — Asks to make a choice (in general).
// Whose — Asks who something belongs to.

// Other question words, like “who” or “how,” aren’t adjectives since they don’t modify nouns. For example, you can say “whose coat is this?” but you can’t say “who coat?”

// Which, what and whose are only considered adjectives if they’re immediately followed by a noun. The word which is an adjective in this sentence: “Which color is your favorite?” But not in this one: “Which is your favorite color?”

// DISTRIBUTIVE ADJECTIVES

// Distributive adjectives describe specific members out of a group. These adjectives are used to single out one or more individual items or people. Some of the most common distributive adjectives include:

// Each — Every single one of a group (used to speak about group members individually).
// Every — Every single one of a group (used to make generalizations).
// Either — One between a choice of two.
// Neither — Not one or the other between a choice of two.
// Any — One or some things out of any number of choices. This is also used when the choice is irrelevant, like: “it doesn’t matter, I’ll take any of them.”
// These adjectives are always followed by the noun or pronoun they’re modifying.


// There are only three articles in the English language: a, an and the.

// A — A singular, general item.
// An — A singular, general item. Use this before words that start with a vowel.
// The — A singular or plural, specific item.

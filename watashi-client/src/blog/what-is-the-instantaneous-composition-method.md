# What is the Instantaneous Composition Method?

The Instantaneous Composition Method is an effective method for learning Japanese Grammar. It involves mass translating English sentences into Japanese, and vice versa. It is essentially what professional translators do on a daily basis.

The main difference 

Before we get into that however, let's explore some of the key reasons why the Instantaneous Composition Method is effective. 

For starters, it is an active use of the language. Far too often students of Japanese spend far too much time reading about various grammar rules, without actually testing themselves effectively. 

Usually what happens is students will attempt to practice their grammar knowledge by reading various articles in Japanese. Unfortunately, this is not an effective approach. Unless if the text is specific to the grammar (perhaps as part of an actual structured Japanese course), then you'll spend a lot of time not practicing the grammar you're hoping to learn. 

And even in this situation, usually only one or two substantial texts are provided for us to 

To better understand why the Instantaneous Composition Method is effective, it can help to understand what Watashi Engine does in order to maximise it's efficiency. 

## What Watashi Engine does

Watashi Engine has been designed solely to facilitate the Instantaneous Composition Method, and in the process is addresses a lot of the pitfalls and inefficiencies of relying on only a handful of preconfigured text to learn grammar.

For example, Watashi Engine has the ability to randomly generate accurate Japanese and English sentences. What this means is that you don't end up memorising the same sentences with the same words and context. 

Instead, what Watashi Engine allows you to do is actively engage your brain so that it is practicing the grammar, as opposed to remembering the answer. 

In order to aid this, Watashi Engine is also highly configurable. What this allows you to do is specify exactly the grammar you want to learn, as well as combine that with other different types of grammar in order to pin-point weak spots in your understanding of Japanese grammar.

To assist you we've also created a structured grammar course which provides pre-configured lessons, which we believe may be valuable in terms of which areas of Japanese grammar people may struggle.

# worker_processes tells you how many instances of nginx to run. To accommodate for more load, it is recommended to set it to auto (one per core).
# worker_connections outlines how many connections can be processed at one time by the worker. Here is a reference that talks about worker_connections in more detail.
# log_format adds specific fields to the logs. When working with extra directives, it helps to put in custom fields for debugging. In particular, I wanted to output my upstream server address.
# upstream is a group of servers that can be accessed by specific directives, including proxy_pass. Weâ€™ve also got a server directive under upstream which brings up the nginx web server and tells it which port to listen to (in my case, 8080).
# There are also location directives that contain information about how the request should be proxied. Namely, proxy_pass has the protocol and address of where the proxy should go.

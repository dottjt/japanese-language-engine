So these are the verb types that need to be done. 

  // Four suffixes consistently added to a verbâ€™s base create all forms of a verb used in all tenses:

  // 1. -s          creates 3rd person singular / present tense  (He talks.)
  
  // 2. -ing       creates the present participle / used with be  (He is talking.)
  
  // 3. -ed        creates the simple past  (He talked.)
  
  // 4. -en        creates the past participle / used with have  (He has talked.)


Examples:

(to write)

Smith writes short stories at home. (-s ending)

Smith is writing short stories at home. (-ing ending)

Smith wrote short stories at home. (-ed ending)
